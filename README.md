Objective:

Build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provide users with a minimalistic chat interface and the possibility to share images and their location.

User Stories:
As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

Key Features:
A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.

A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.

When the user clicks the "Start Chatting" button, the athentication will take place. The App is using an Anonymous Authentication and the user will not be prompted for credentials. Because of the Anonymous Authentication the user can only see the history of his conversations as long as he is using the same device he was authenticated with.

Pressing the "+" button inside the message input,will open a menu where the user can choose whether to select an image from the device's library, take a new picture or send their location.

The chat provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.

Data gets stored online and offline.
